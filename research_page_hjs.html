						  <h2><center>WASP-47 and Forming Hot Jupiters</center></h2>
                        <p> Named to JPL's list of the top 20 Most Intriguing Exoplanets, the WASP-47 system (Michigan press release linked here) was the first system containing a hot Jupiter to be found to also contain additional, close-in planetary companions. In this work, we also confirmed the planetary nature of the ~9 day period candidate and predicted the planetary masses in the WASP-47 system by fitting the transit timing variations. The masses derived with this method are consistent with the RV masses later measured by other methods (see their paper here; collaborator Andrew Vanderburg also led an RV analysis, to which I contributed, here; Lauren Weiss led a simultaneous RV and TTV analysis here). Ideally, the discovery of more systems of this nature will enable an eventual statistical study of the differences between hot Jupiters with and without nearby companions. </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The obliquities of cool stars hosting hot Jupiters tend to be aligned. Some of these systems have extra companions, with orbits well exterior to the hot Jupiter's orbit. Because these companions were discovered with RVs, we do not know their inclinations relative to the hot Jupiter's orbit (see schematic above). </p>
