My Newest Results
								  </center></h2>
								</header>
								<p> My current research focuses on using theoretical techniques to get the most out of data collected by the TESS mission. TESS is (even as you read this page!) discovering new planets and new system architectures, which will eventually be used to provide observational tests as we assemble of coherent theory of planet formation. Before that can happen, however, we must attempt to understand these systems as best we can with the limited quantity of data available, and determine which sources will be the most fruitful for future observational studies. 
									<br>
									
									<p><ol>For some of the newest results I’ve contributed to, take a look at the following papers: 
<li>A TESS system (TOI-1130) containing a hot Jupiter with an interior companion: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10852.pdf"> Huang, Quinn, Vanderburg, Becker et al. (2020) </a></li>
<li>A few recent results I’ve contributed to which came out of the DES TNO group: a hunt for Earth trojans with DECam, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08229.pdf"> Markwardt et al. (2020)</a>; a detection of diatomic carbon in interstellar comet Borisov, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06161.pdf"> Lin et al. (2020)</a>; a census of DES’s discovered objects <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01478.pdf"> Markwardt et al. (2020)</a>, </li>
	<li>See <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~talikh/">
Tali Khain’s</a> paper on the classification of each of the DES KBOs: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06060.pdf"> Khain, Becker, et al. (2020)</a>
 </li></ol>

<p> I am also currently working on combining observational data with theoretical modeling to better understand how hot Jupiters form (see migration mechanisms above), and what system factors determine the branching ratios between the various mechanisms.  </p>

								My past research has focused on exoplanets and the solar system: I have discovered new objects in the solar system and new planets orbiting other stars, and used these discoveries to learn more about how planets form. To learn more about what I work on, check out the following blog posts, papers, and summaries of my past work.

									  I study planets and try to learn how they formed, both in our own solar system and around distant stars

								<p> I am currently a 51 Pegasi b Fellow at Caltech. Previously, I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow and Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics Graduate Fellow at the University of Michigan, where I obtained my PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics. My advisor was Professor Fred Adams. During my PhD research, I studied the dynamics of both exoplanetary systems and of our own solar system, and led the discovery of two new planets in the WASP-47 system and a Trans-Neptunian Object in our own solar system, 2015 BP-519.  </p>

										<p> My research recently has focused on deriving fundamental properties of astrophysical objects using dynamical techniques. As an undergraduate, I majored in Astrophysics (with a minor in English) at Caltech. I am also particularly interested in teaching, and I have gained experience by serving as a GSI (graduate student instructor) for multiple classes, mentoring multiple students in astrophysics research, and tutoring both high school and undergraduate students.</p>
