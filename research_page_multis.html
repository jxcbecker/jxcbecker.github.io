						  <center><h4>Studying Multi-Planet Systems Towards Understanding the Kepler Dichotomy</h4></center>
                        <p>Inspired by the large number of multi-planet systems discovered by Kepler, in Becker & Adams (2016), I used secular Laplace-Lagrange theory to find that self-interactions within Kepler multi-planet systems are not sufficient to perturb the multi-planet systems out of a  transiting state. In Becker & Adams (2017a), we performed a Monte Carlo study of the effect of unseen perturbing bodies  in  these  systems and  determined  the  regimes  in  these  systems  where  companions  could reside. The goal was to derive insights about the stability of Kepler multi-planet systems. We found these systems may host additional planets and be fruitful targets for future study. </p>

						    <center><h4>Extracting Radial Velocities from A- and B-type Stars</h4></center> <img src="images/Thumbnail_-_B_Stars.jpg" style='float: right;' width ="150" alt="">
                        <p>One of the first projects I completed in astronomy, in this work I derived absolute radial velocities for B-type stars using calibration spectra from the California Planet Search. The spectra came from the HIRES echelle spectrograph on Keck. We were able to derive RVs with typically between 1.5 km/s - 3.5 km/s precision. </p>
